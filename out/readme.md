oh i know what youre doing

if youre here for the solutions to get your star,
id ask you to first consider doing the problems
yourselves before resorting to my bullshit.

if you really can't solve it, and i did solve it,
then have at it, but be sure to come back after
the fact, maybe read through my code, and 
figure out what went wrong and how you can learn from
whatever mistake you made

the game's for fun, not a competition for stars
